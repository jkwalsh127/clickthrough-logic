## Description
This project was intended to build logic that could utilize data retrieved from users interacting with an application. This is meant to mimic business situations where we want people to ultimately buy a product or sign up for a service. By tracking user interaction, we can use logic to determine the percentage of users that we convert, and even determine where in the process unconverted users quit the process. While this statistics are interesting at face-value, this also helps a UI designer to optimize the process in an attempt to improve conversion numbers.
